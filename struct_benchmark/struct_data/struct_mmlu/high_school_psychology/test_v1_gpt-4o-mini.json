With regard to study-skills training, the school psychologist should stress which of the following principles while advising Ms. Harcar?",
        "choices": [
            "The study skills of students with disabilities are improved when they are given a single, specific study strategy to follow for all subjects.",
            "Students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and need only some guidance and reinforcement by the teacher.",
            "Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.",
            "Study strategies are best taught in a small group by having students practice collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher."
