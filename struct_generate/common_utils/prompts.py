### Example 1
Topic: Apple Pie

<Start of Provided Document>
At high altitudes, bakers face unique challenges due to the reduced air pressure. In these conditions, leavening gases in baked goods, like those produced by baking powder, expand more than they would at sea level. This increased expansion can cause the crusts of breads and pastries to rise excessively, leading to an overly airy or dry texture. To counteract this, it's advisable to reduce the amount of baking powder used in recipes when baking at high altitudes. This adjustment helps maintain the desired texture and prevents the crust from becoming too light and brittle.
