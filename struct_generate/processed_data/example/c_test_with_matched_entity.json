Autonomic does not mean automatic. The term \"autonomic\" is an anatomical term and it refers  to a type of nervous system in animals and humans  that is very primitive. \"Skeletal\" or \"somatic\" are,  similarly, anatomical terms that refer to a type of nervous system that is more recent in terms of  evolutionary development. There are autonomic  reflexes and skeletal, somatic reflexes. Myotatic reflexes. The myotatic or muscle stretch reflexes (sometimes known as \"deep tendon reflexes\") provide information on the integrity of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. This information can be detected using electromyography (EMG). Generally, decreased reflexes indicate a peripheral problem, and lively or exaggerated reflexes a central one. A stretch reflex is the contraction of a muscle in response to its lengthwise stretch."

This reflex is mediated by the S1 spinal segment of the spinal cord. Procedure and components. Ankle of the patient is relaxed. It is helpful to support the ball of the foot at least somewhat to put some tension in the Achilles tendon, but donâ€™t completely dorsiflex the ankle. A small strike is given on the Achilles tendon using a rubber hammer to elicit the response."

Many animals, most significantly humans, have been seen to have the patellar reflex, including dogs, cats, horses, and other mammalian species.  Mechanism. Striking of the patellar tendon with a reflex hammer just below the patella stretches the muscle spindle in the quadriceps muscle. This produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses (without interneurons) at the level of L3 or L4 in the spinal cord, completely independent of higher centres. From there, an alpha motor neuron conducts an efferent impulse back to the quadriceps femoris muscle, triggering contraction. This contraction, coordinated with the relaxation of the antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle causes the leg to kick. There is a latency of around 18 ms between stretch of the patellar tendon and the beginning of contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscle. This is a reflex of proprioception which helps maintain posture and balance, allowing to keep one's balance with little effort or conscious thought."

The lateral side of the sole of the foot is rubbed with a blunt instrument or device so as not to cause pain, discomfort, or injury to the skin; the instrument is run from the heel along a curve to the toes (metatarsal pads)."
