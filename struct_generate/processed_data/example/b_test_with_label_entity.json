                    "wiki_page": "Automatic, involuntary response to a stimulus\nIn biology, a reflex, or reflex action, is an involuntary, unplanned sequence or action and nearly instantaneous response to a stimulus.\nReflexes are found with varying levels of complexity in organisms with a nervous system. A reflex occurs via neural pathways in the nervous system called reflex arcs. A stimulus initiates a neural signal, which is carried to a synapse. The signal is then transferred across the synapse to a motor neuron, which evokes a target response. These neural signals do not always travel to the brain, so many reflexes are an automatic response to a stimulus that does not receive or need conscious thought.\nMany reflexes are fine-tuned to increase organism survival and self-defense. This is observed in reflexes such as the startle reflex, which provides an automatic response to an unexpected stimulus, and the feline righting reflex, which reorients a cat's body when falling to ensure safe landing. The simplest type of reflex, a short-latency reflex, has a single synapse, or junction, in the signaling pathway. Long-latency reflexes produce nerve signals that are transduced across multiple synapses before generating the reflex response.\nTypes of human reflexes.\nAutonomic vs skeletal reflexes.\n\"Reflex\" is an anatomical concept and it refers to a \nloop consisting, in its simplest form, of a sensory\nnerve, the input, and a motor nerve, the output. \nAutonomic does not mean automatic. The term \"autonomic\" is an anatomical term and it refers \nto a type of nervous system in animals and humans \nthat is very primitive. \"Skeletal\" or \"somatic\" are, \nsimilarly, anatomical terms that refer to a type of\nnervous system that is more recent in terms of \nevolutionary development. There are autonomic \nreflexes and skeletal, somatic reflexes.\nMyotatic reflexes.\nThe myotatic or muscle stretch reflexes (sometimes known as \"deep tendon reflexes\") provide information on the integrity of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. This information can be detected using electromyography (EMG). Generally, decreased reflexes indicate a peripheral problem, and lively or exaggerated reflexes a central one. A stretch reflex is the contraction of a muscle in response to its lengthwise stretch.\nWhile the reflexes above are stimulated mechanically, the term H-reflex refers to the analogous reflex stimulated electrically, and tonic vibration reflex for those stimulated to vibration.\nTendon reflex.\nA tendon reflex is the contraction of a muscle in response to striking its tendon. The Golgi tendon reflex is the inverse of a stretch reflex.\nReflexes usually only observed in human infants.\nNewborn babies have a number of other reflexes which are not seen in adults, referred to as primitive reflexes. These automatic reactions to stimuli enable infants to respond to the environment before any learning has taken place. They include:\nOther kinds of reflexes.\nOther reflexes found in the central nervous system include:\nMany of these reflexes are quite complex, requiring a number of synapses in a number of different nuclei in the central nervous system (e.g., the escape reflex). Others of these involve just a couple of synapses to function (e.g., the withdrawal reflex).\nProcesses such as breathing, digestion, and the maintenance of the heartbeat can also be regarded as reflex actions, according to some definitions of the term.\nGrading.\nIn medicine, reflexes are often used to assess the health of the nervous system. Doctors will typically grade the activity of a reflex on a scale from 0 to 4. While 2+ is considered normal, some healthy individuals are hypo-reflexive and register all reflexes at 1+, while others are hyper-reflexive and register all reflexes at 3+.\nDepending on where you are, another way of grading is from –4 (absent) to +4 (clonus), where 0 is \"normal\".\nReflex modulation.\nSome might imagine that reflexes are immutable. In reality, however, most reflexes are flexible and can be substantially modified to match the requirements of the behavior in both vertebrates and invertebrates.\nA good example of reflex modulation is the stretch reflex. When a muscle is stretched at rest, the stretch reflex leads to contraction of the muscle, thereby opposing stretch (resistance reflex). This helps to stabilize posture. During voluntary movements, however, the intensity (gain) of the reflex is reduced or its sign is even reversed. This prevents resistance reflexes from impeding movements.\nThe underlying sites and mechanisms of reflex modulation are not fully understood. There is evidence that the output of sensory neurons is directly modulated during behavior—for example, through presynaptic inhibition. The effect of sensory input upon motor neurons is also influenced by interneurons in the spinal cord or ventral nerve cord and by descending signals from the brain.\nOther reflexes.\nBreathing can also be considered both involuntary and voluntary, since breath can be held through internal intercostal muscles.\n",

Nerve roots can be classified as:\nCranial nerve roots.\nCranial nerves originate directly from the brain's surface: two from the cerebrum and the ten others from the brain stem. Cranial roots differ from spinal roots: some of these roots do not separate into individual sensory (dorsal) and motor (ventral) roots, but can emerge from one fusion root instead; of the eleven cranial nerves, four express this concept of fusion. The remaining eight nerve roots only express one of the two types of connections. Five of these are exclusive motor roots, and the remaining three are all sensory.\nSpinal nerve roots.\nSpinal nerve roots are much more uniform than cranial nerves, one emerging from each level of the spinal column. These roots look extremely similar to one another, and form separate sensory and motor root connections to the central nervous system. Sensory nerves all enter the column as dorsal nerve roots, while motor nerves enter as ventral roots. They are expressed uniformly on both sides of each vertebra along the spinal column.\nThe specific vertebrae classify spinal nerve roots they originate from. These are separated into three sections: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral. The cervical is separated into eight vertebrae named C1-C8. The thoracic segment consists of T1-T12; the lumbar is L1-L5; and sacral S1-S5.\nPain and pathologies.\nDamage to nerve roots can cause paresis and paralysis of the muscle innervated by the affected spinal nerve. It may also cause pain and numbness in the corresponding dermatome. A common cause of damage to the nerve roots is spine lesions, such as prolapse of the nucleus pulposus, spinal tuberculosis, cancer, inflammation, spinal tabs. Root pain syndromes, known colloquially as radiculitis and sciatica, are among the most common symptoms caused by damage to the nerve root. Radiculopathy is commonly called the \"root\". In addition to pain, nerve damage may lead to impaired muscle control. Typically, mechanical dysfunction is caused by pressure on the nerve root or shock, affecting both the lower limbs and arms' roots.\nThe first sign of disease (sometimes preceding the occurrence of the radicular syndrome by up to a few years) is a sensation of pain in the neck and shoulder area. This pain often manifests due to hypothermia, poor posture or ergonomics during work or sleep, or sudden head movement. Team roots are localized mostly within the three lower cervical roots, namely C5, C6, and C7.\nTreatment.\nTreatment should be initiated as early as possible, before any muscle tone increases, which further intensifies the pain. Traction is recommended to decompress compressed roots. Radiculopathy can be caused by herniated nucleus pulposus. Surgery is the last resort when conservative therapy is unsuccessful.\nLower limb radiculopathies.\nThe cause is a herniated intervertebral disc, often on a single nerve root. The first sign of the nerve root sickness is usually lumbago, which usually occurs with periods of remission. The time to develop a full radicular syndrome may take several months or several years. Pain generally increases gradually, but it can also be sudden. Cold causes muscle contraction, which leads to increased previously hidden symptoms.\nTreatment.\nTreatment can vary based on the nature and severity of the disease. A compressed nerve root can cause radicular pain with or without radiculopathy. Most of the time, symptoms from a compressed nerve will start to feel better within 6 to 12 weeks of nonsurgical treatment.\nTo unlock the nerve root in the acute phase, it is recommended to apply traction and isometric muscle relaxation, and should be the first procedure to be performed in cases of severe pain. In cases where manipulation is undesirable or impossible to carry out, the infiltration may be root. Anti-inflammatory medications may be used to alleviate symptoms. In the acute setting, the main goal is to restore proper mobility by reducing pain. Surgery is used when other methods do not produce results, except when paralysis is observed; in those cases, surgery should be performed as soon as possible to avoid irreversible paralysis of muscles.\n",

Many animals, most significantly humans, have been seen to have the patellar reflex, including dogs, cats, horses, and other mammalian species. \nMechanism.\nStriking of the patellar tendon with a reflex hammer just below the patella stretches the muscle spindle in the quadriceps muscle. This produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses (without interneurons) at the level of L3 or L4 in the spinal cord, completely independent of higher centres. From there, an alpha motor neuron conducts an efferent impulse back to the quadriceps femoris muscle, triggering contraction. This contraction, coordinated with the relaxation of the antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle causes the leg to kick. There is a latency of around 18 ms between stretch of the patellar tendon and the beginning of contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscle. This is a reflex of proprioception which helps maintain posture and balance, allowing to keep one's balance with little effort or conscious thought.\nThe patellar reflex is a clinical and classic example of the monosynaptic reflex arc. There is no interneuron in the pathway leading to contraction of the quadriceps muscle. Instead, the sensory neuron synapses directly on a motor neuron in the spinal cord. However, there \"is\" an inhibitory interneuron used to relax the antagonistic hamstring muscle (reciprocal innervation).\nThis test of a basic automatic reflex may be influenced by the patient consciously inhibiting or exaggerating the response; the doctor may use the Jendrassik maneuver in order to ensure a more valid reflex test.\nClinical significance.\nAfter the tap of a hammer, the leg is normally extended once and comes to rest. The absence or decrease of this reflex is problematic, and known as Westphal's sign. This reflex may be diminished or absent in lower motor neuron lesions and during sleep. On the other hand, multiple oscillation of the leg (pendular reflex) following the tap may be a sign of cerebellar diseases. Exaggerated (brisk) deep tendon reflexes such as this can be found in upper motor neuron lesions, hyperthyroidism, anxiety or nervousness. The test itself assesses the nervous tissue between and including the L2 and L4 segments of the spinal cord.\nThe patellar reflex is often tested in infants to test the nervous system.\nHistory.\nWilhelm Heinrich Erb (1840–1921) and Carl Friedrich Westphal (1833–1890) simultaneously reported the patellar tendon or knee reflex in 1875. The term \"knee-jerk\" was recorded by Sir Michael Foster in his Textbook of physiology in 1877: \"Striking the tendon below the patella gives rise to a sudden extension of the leg, known as the knee-jerk.\"\nIn popular culture.\nThe term began to be used figuratively from the early 20th century onwards. O. O. McIntyre, in his New York Day-By-Day column in The Coshocton Tribune, October 1921, wrote: \"Itinerant preacher stemming Broadway on a soap box. And gets only an occasional knee-jerk.\"\n",

Many reflex hammers taper at the end of the handle to a point which was used for testing the plantar response in the past; due to the tightening of infection control regulation this is no longer recommended. Either a single use device or the thumb nail should be used.\nThere are three responses possible:\nAs the lesion responsible for the sign expands, so does the area from which the afferent Babinski response may be elicited. The Babinski response is also normal while asleep and after a long period of walking.\nInterpretation.\nThe Babinski sign can indicate upper motor neuron lesion constituting damage to the corticospinal tract. Occasionally, a pathological plantar reflex is the first and only indication of a serious disease process and a clearly abnormal plantar reflex often prompts detailed neurological investigations, including CT scanning of the brain or MRI of the spine, as well as lumbar puncture for the study of cerebrospinal fluid.\nThe phrase \"negative Babinski sign\" is sometimes used for the normal flexor plantar response.\nIn infants.\nInfants will usually show an extensor response. In one study of 256 healthy infants, the response to testing was extensor in 73.8%, flexor in 8.9%, and equivocal in 17.3% This extensor response occurs because the corticospinal pathways that run from the brain down the spinal cord are not fully myelinated at this age, so the reflex is not inhibited by the cerebral cortex. The extensor response usually disappears – giving way to the flexor response – by 12 months of age. Its persistence beyond age 2–3 indicates a problem in the brain or spinal cord.\nRelationship to Hoffmann's reflex.\nThe Hoffmann's reflex is sometimes described as the upper limb equivalent of the Babinski sign because both indicate upper motor neuron dysfunction. Mechanistically, they differ significantly; the finger flexor reflex is a simple monosynaptic spinal reflex involving the flexor digitorum profundus that is normally fully inhibited by upper motor neurons. The pathway producing the plantar response is more complicated, and is not monosynaptic.\nBabinski-like responses.\nThe plantar reflex can be elicited in a number of ways, which were described in the late 19th and early 20th century. These have their own eponyms.\n",
