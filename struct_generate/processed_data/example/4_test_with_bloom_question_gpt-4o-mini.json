            "related_content": "\"Reflex\" is an anatomical concept and it refers to a  loop consisting, in its simplest form, of a sensory nerve, the input, and a motor nerve, the output.  Autonomic does not mean automatic. The term \"autonomic\" is an anatomical term and it refers  to a type of nervous system in animals and humans  that is very primitive. \"Skeletal\" or \"somatic\" are,  similarly, anatomical terms that refer to a type of nervous system that is more recent in terms of  evolutionary development. There are autonomic  reflexes and skeletal, somatic reflexes. Myotatic reflexes. The myotatic or muscle stretch reflexes (sometimes known as \"deep tendon reflexes\") provide information on the integrity of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. This information can be detected using electromyography (EMG). Generally, decreased reflexes indicate a peripheral problem, and lively or exaggerated reflexes a central one. A stretch reflex is the contraction of a muscle in response to its lengthwise stretch.\nWhile the reflexes above are stimulated mechanically, the term H-reflex refers to the analogous reflex stimulated electrically, and tonic vibration reflex for those stimulated to vibration. Tendon reflex. A tendon reflex is the contraction of a muscle in response to striking its tendon. The Golgi tendon reflex is the inverse of a stretch reflex. Reflexes usually only observed in human infants. Newborn babies have a number of other reflexes which are not seen in adults, referred to as primitive reflexes. These automatic reactions to stimuli enable infants to respond to the environment before any learning has taken place. They include: Other kinds of reflexes. Other reflexes found in the central nervous system include: Many of these reflexes are quite complex, requiring a number of synapses in a number of different nuclei in the central nervous system (e.g., the escape reflex). Others of these involve just a couple of synapses to function (e.g., the withdrawal reflex). Processes such as breathing, digestion, and the maintenance of the heartbeat can also be regarded as reflex actions, according to some definitions of the term. Grading. In medicine, reflexes are often used to assess the health of the nervous system.\nAutomatic, involuntary response to a stimulus In biology, a reflex, or reflex action, is an involuntary, unplanned sequence or action and nearly instantaneous response to a stimulus. Reflexes are found with varying levels of complexity in organisms with a nervous system. A reflex occurs via neural pathways in the nervous system called reflex arcs. A stimulus initiates a neural signal, which is carried to a synapse. The signal is then transferred across the synapse to a motor neuron, which evokes a target response. These neural signals do not always travel to the brain, so many reflexes are an automatic response to a stimulus that does not receive or need conscious thought. Many reflexes are fine-tuned to increase organism survival and self-defense. This is observed in reflexes such as the startle reflex, which provides an automatic response to an unexpected stimulus, and the feline righting reflex, which reorients a cat's body when falling to ensure safe landing. The simplest type of reflex, a short-latency reflex, has a single synapse, or junction, in the signaling pathway. Long-latency reflexes produce nerve signals that are transduced across multiple synapses before generating the reflex response. Types of human reflexes. Autonomic vs skeletal reflexes."
